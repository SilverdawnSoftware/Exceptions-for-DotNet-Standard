# .Net Standard Exceptions

This is a simple implementation of an exception logging class.

This provides a base level of exception logging for use with the .Net Standard library's for the Code Generators. 

This implementation can be expanded to meet your exception logging standards. e.g NLog, Exceptionless etc. Just change the LogFactory to point to your implementation.

Sample Exceptionless client included
